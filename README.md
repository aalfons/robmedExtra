# robmedExtra: Extra Functionality for (Robust) Mediation Analysis

This companion package extends the package [`robmed`](https://github.com/aalfons/robmed) in various ways.  Most notably, it provides:

- A graphical user interface (GUI) for the robust bootstrap test ROBMED ([Alfons, Ates & Groenen, 2022a](https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428121999096)) to make the method more accessible to less proficient `R` users, implemented as a `shiny` app. The GUI allows to easily export results for reporting, including a replication file in the form of an `R` script.
- Functions to export the results from mediation analysis as a table in a Microsoft Word or Powerpoint document, or as a `LaTeX` table.
- A `shiny` app to compare various bootstrap procedures for mediation analysis on simulated data.

## About ROBMED

The robust bootstrap test ROBMED for mediation analysis is less sensitive to deviations from model assumptions (such as outliers or heavily tailed distributions) than the standard bootstrap test of Preacher & Hayes ([2004](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03206553), [2008](https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.40.3.879)).  ROBMED utilizes the robust MM-regression estimator ([Yohai, 1987](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1176350366)) instead of the OLS estimator for regression, and runs bootstrap tests with the fast and robust bootstrap methodology ([Salibián-Barrera & Zamar, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1021379865); [Salibián-Barrera & Van Aelst, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2008.05.007)).
